![LUSID by Finbourne](https://content.finbourne.com/LUSID_repo.png)

These are the C# SDK Extensions (Preview) to accompany the [C# SDK (Preview) for the Notification application](https://github.com/finbourne/notifications-sdk-csharp-preview). The Notification application provides notifications via email, SMS or webhook when LUSID events occur.

This extensions package provides the user with additional extensions to make it easy to configure and use the API endpoints. This repository contains examples of how to use these additional extensions in the Finbourne.Notifications.Sdk.Extensions.Tutorials project.

The Notification application is part of the [LUSID by FINBOURNE](https://www.finbourne.com/lusid-technology) platform. To use it you'll need a LUSID account. [Sign up for free at lusid.com](https://www.lusid.com/app/signup).
